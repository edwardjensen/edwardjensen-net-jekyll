# It's nice to meet you! I'm Edward Jensen.

My work focuses on harnessing technology and data to amplify mission impact for nonprofit organizations. I am the Director of Information Technology for [MEDA, the Metropolitan Economic Development Association](https://www.meda.net/), in Minneapolis.

On these pages, I share insights from inside the work. As a nonprofit IT leader, I focus on technology strategy, institutional resilience, knowledge enterprise development: the tactical realities of advancing IT within mission-driven organizations.
