Inspired by [Tom MacWright's "Uses"](https://macwright.com/uses/) list and the [Uses This interview series](https://usesthis.com/), here's mine. Links provided are to the manufacturer's page, where appropriate. None of the links are affiliate links.

- **Computer**: I switch between a desktop Mac Studio M3 Ultra and my MacBook Pro M3. The Mac Studio is the beefier of the two, because it's connected to multiple storage arrays and hard-wired by 10 Gbps Ethernet to a NAS. The MacBook Pro is just a wonderful little device when I don't want to work at my home office desk.
- **Desk monitors, keyboard, and mouse**: In 2017, I bought 2 Dell P2715Q monitors. They were, at the time, the smallest 4K monitors, and my old 2013 "trashcan" Mac Pro powered them beautifully. They still work amazingly well, and I have no desire to replace them. The keyboard is a [Keychron V6-D1](https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-v6-custom-mechanical-keyboard) and my mouse is a [Logitech Lift](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-mac.910-006471.html).
- **Speakers and audio**: I always have music running when I'm working at my desk. My Mac Studio's connected to a TEAC AI-503 digital audio converter and amplifier combo, with two [Micca MB42x](https://www.miccatron.com/micca-mb42x/) speakers doing the honors.
- **Storage and Server Capacity**: I have a Dell PowerEdge R740xd 2U rackmount server with about 25 TB of storage, but plenty of computing performance for a number of server and homelab tasks. The server runs Windows Server 2016 and a few Hyper-V containers. My Mac Studio has a Thunderbolt 2 hard drive array plugged into the Mac Studio (using a [TB2-to-TB3 converter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MYH93AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter)). The TB2 hard drive array works well, so why replace that?
- **Fancy studio stuff**: I have a [RØDE RØDECaster Duo](https://rode.com/en-us/interfaces-and-mixers/rodecaster-series/rodecaster-duo) connected to a [Shure SM7B microphone](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B). (The dream is to have the [Cole Electroacoustics 4104 lip ribbon mic](https://coleselectroacoustics.com/4104-commentators-microphone/), for no reason *other than*.) For lighting, I have an [Amaran COB 60x LED monolight](https://amarancreators.com/pages/amaran-cob-60x-s) as a key light, an [Amaran P60x LED panel](https://amarancreators.com/pages/amaran-p60x) as a back light, and odds-and-ends to connect them together.
- **Coding**: Visual Studio Code with GitHub. I don't have a lot of extra herbs and spices with VS Code other than the things I need to support whatever projects I'm working on.
- **Photography**: [Canon EOS R7](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-r7) mirrorless camera with assorted lenses. Adobe Lightroom Classic for digital asset management, and Adobe Photoshop for more involved photo editing.
- **Pens and notebooks**. I'm a big user of fountain pens. My daily pens are a couple of [TWSBI](https://www.twsbi.com/) 580s, and my go-to black ink is [Noodler's Ink Heart of Darkness](https://noodlersink.com/product/19808-heart-of-darkness-4-5-oz/). My standard loose-leaf paper is the HP 32 lb. paper.
- **3D printing and CAD modeling**: I have a Bambu Lab P1s, purchased before the [Bambu Labs firmware issues](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/bambu-lab-pushes-a-control-system-for-3d-printers-and-boy-did-it-not-go-well/). I create models on [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/) and export them as STL files for the Bambu Labs slicer app. The Bambu printer's on a separate VLAN with appropriate firewall and network precautions made.
- **Other software**: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for notes and the CMS for this website. [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/), usually running [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). Microsoft 365, both home and for enterprise. Microsoft Edge. [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) for running local copies of LLMs. [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) for more intense tasks. [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/) for tracking shopping needs. The iOS Reminders app for task management.
- **This site**: This site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using [GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/), and the static HTML pages are on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
