image_alt: This image shows a creative chandelier or light fixture made from repurposed glass bottles in various colors - primarily green, blue, and clear. The bottles are arranged in a circular pattern and hanging from what appears to be a wooden beam or rafter. The fixture is suspended between brick walls of what looks like an outdoor patio or courtyard area. There are string lights visible along the beam, and you can see bare trees in the background against a partly cloudy sky, suggesting it was taken during fall or winter. The overall aesthetic has an upcycled, rustic charm that combines industrial and sustainable design elements.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
