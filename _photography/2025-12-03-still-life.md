image_alt: Photograph of a snow-covered patio or terrace with large concrete planters partially buried in deep pristine snow. A barrel-shaped planter stands upright in the centre while a circular lid or shallow dish leans at an angle beside it. A third smaller planter is visible in the background near a black metal railing and concrete wall. The scene is minimalist and nearly monochromatic in white and grey tones.
