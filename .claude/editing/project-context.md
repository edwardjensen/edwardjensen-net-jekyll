# Project Context

You are helping develop, refine, and edit blog posts for my blog. The principal purpose of the blog is to share thoughts at the intersection of information technology and nonprofit organizations. While previously the focus was on urban design and central-city Phoenix issues, it's moving toward IT matters.

It's a personal blog, so I am the only author of posts. There is not a formal editorial process. It's OK to talk about work items, but any specific information about my employer or clients should be avoided, only speaking in generalities.

Use American English spelling and terminology in responses and in editorial suggestions.

## Folder Specifics

The `_posts` folder contains blog posts in Markdown format. This will help you get a sense of my writing style.

## Author Background

**Edward Jensen** is the Director of Information Technology at MEDA (Metropolitan Economic Development Association) in Minneapolis. His work focuses on:

- **IT Leadership**: Organizational resilience, knowledge enterprise leadership, systems integrations, and IT as a mission multiplier in nonprofit organizations
- **Geographic Context**: Moved from Phoenix, Arizona to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota in 2022 (hence the shift in blog focus from Phoenix urban design to nonprofit IT)
- **Previous Work**: Ran an independent consulting firm in Phoenix focused on IT and communication strategy; created *The Downtown Phoenix Podcast* (8 episodes, 2014), a critically acclaimed civic conversation program
- **Civic Engagement**: Currently serves on Board of Directors for Public Art Saint Paul and advises Minnesota CDFI Coalition
- **Speaking/Writing**: Author of *A Brief History of Midtown Phoenix* lecture series (debuted 2019); photographer whose work has appeared in books on central-city Phoenix history

This background informs the blog's perspective: pragmatic nonprofit IT leadership, urban design/civic engagement history, and cross-sector collaboration experience.

## Current Blog Themes & Recent Posts (Oct-Nov 2025)

### Primary Topics

**AI and Technology**: Recent posts reflect ongoing exploration of AI's practical applications in nonprofit contexts. Eddie views AI as a tool with specific strengths (well-defined tasks, content editing, code generation, document processing) but limitations (no critical thinking, struggles with ambiguous tasks). He advocates for a pragmatic "middle ground" approach rather than hype or doom. Recent posts include:

- "Meet Me in the AI Middle" (Nov 2025) - balanced perspective on AI in mission-driven nonprofits
- "AI Confidence Probabilities" (Jun 2025) - technical deep-dive on how AI confidence metrics work
- "Seriously Unserious: Bad AI In A Site" (Jul 2025) - learning project using local LLM inference

**Site/Meta Posts**: Documentation of website evolution and technical decisions:

- Recently migrated from WordPress to Jekyll static site generator
- Using Cloudflare Pages for deployment
- New features include search (via Lunr.js), responsive layout, nested navigation, image lightbox gallery
- "Vibe coding" with AI tools (GitHub Copilot) for rapid feature development
- Archiving old Phoenix-era posts with graceful redirects

**Nonprofit IT and Cybersecurity**: Practical IT leadership perspectives:

- Invoice fraud tactics and prevention
- QR code phishing attacks
- Security awareness topics
- CRM and document recognition automation projects

**Personal/Career Reflection**:

- Request for podcast guests (interested in nonprofit IT stories, 10-year anniversary of Downtown Phoenix Podcast)
- Career reflection and mission-driven work

### Writing Style Observations

- Clear, conversational tone that doesn't shy away from personality
- Technical posts are accessible to non-specialists
- Includes practical examples and real-world scenarios
- Frequently references own projects and hands-on experience
- Uses disclaimers about employer/client confidentiality
- Mix of "serious" technical posts and lighter/humorous content
- Proper attribution and credit given (alt text, photo credits, etc.)

## Inspirations

The new approach of this blog is inspired by the following people:

- **Scott Hanselman: [hanselman.com](https://www.hanselman.com/).** His approach to recurring blogging, especially as it relates to using blogs instead of emails or one-off communications, will inspire the ad-hoc nature of some content.
- **Tom MacWright: [macwright.com](https://www.macwright.com/).** I like his focus on technology and his integrated form of micro posts.
- **Simon Willison: [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/).** He has a lot of posts that are single-subject, short, and to the point.
