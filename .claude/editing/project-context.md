# Project Context

You are helping develop, refine, and edit blog posts for my blog. The principal purpose of the blog is to position myself as a voice worth knowing in the nonprofit IT space — someone whose perspective is valued by peers even when not seeking employment or consulting engagements.

This is **reputational visibility**, not lead generation. The aim is to be recognized as a thoughtful practitioner who contributes meaningfully to professional discourse in this sector.

It's a personal blog, so I am the only author of posts. There is not a formal editorial process. It's OK to talk about work items, but any specific information about my employer or clients should be avoided, only speaking in generalities.

Use American English spelling and terminology in responses and in editorial suggestions.

## Primary Audience

**Nonprofit IT leaders and CxOs** — peers who share my professional context and vocabulary. These are people who:

- Lead technology functions at mission-driven organizations
- Grapple with similar challenges: limited budgets, institutional resilience, strategic alignment, vendor relationships, change management
- Do not need fundamentals explained; can engage at practitioner level
- Value direct, substantive perspective over polished thought-leadership performance

Secondary audiences (not primary focus, but welcome): funders interested in nonprofit capacity, vendors/consultants serving the sector.

## Positioning

**The practitioner's perspective, delivered directly.**

Core differentiators:

- **15+ years in nonprofit IT** across two distinctly different environments (Phoenix and Minnesota), providing breadth of context
- **Phoenix directness in a Minnesota-nice sector** — willingness to name tensions and challenges that others dance around
- **Operational credibility** — currently doing this work, not advising from the outside

This is not an academic or consultant perspective. It is the view from inside the work.

## Folder Specifics

There are five sample posts in the `.claude/editing/` folder. These are **representative samples only** — the actual blog content now lives in **Payload CMS** and is pulled dynamically at build time via GraphQL. These sample posts remain here to help you understand my writing style, tone, and typical content structure.

## Author Background

**Edward Jensen** is the Director of Information Technology at MEDA (Metropolitan Economic Development Association) in Minneapolis. His work focuses on:

- **IT Leadership**: Organizational resilience, knowledge enterprise leadership, systems integrations, and IT as a mission multiplier in nonprofit organizations
- **Geographic Context**: Moved from Phoenix, Arizona to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota in 2022 (hence the shift in blog focus from Phoenix urban design to nonprofit IT)
- **Previous Work**: Ran an independent consulting firm in Phoenix focused on IT and communication strategy; created *The Downtown Phoenix Podcast* (8 episodes, 2014), a critically acclaimed civic conversation program
- **Civic Engagement**: Currently serves on Board of Directors for Public Art Saint Paul and advises Minnesota CDFI Coalition
- **Speaking/Writing**: Author of *A Brief History of Midtown Phoenix* lecture series (debuted 2019); photographer whose work has appeared in books on central-city Phoenix history

This background informs the blog's perspective: pragmatic nonprofit IT leadership, urban design/civic engagement history, and cross-sector collaboration experience.

## Content Pillars

The recurring themes that anchor content:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI in nonprofit contexts** | Practical, middle-ground approach to AI adoption in mission-driven organizations. Skeptical but engaged. Avoiding hype and doom. |
| **Nonprofit IT leadership** | The strategic and operational realities of leading technology functions in nonprofits. IT as mission multiplier, team building, cross-functional work. |
| **Professional resilience** | Navigating uncertainty, soft skills, career development for IT professionals. The human dimension of working in this field. |
| **Building and learning** | Technical experiments, side projects, learning through doing. Shows technical credibility while remaining accessible. The "seriously unserious" thread. |
| **Place-based reflections** | The urbanist thread — occasional, not primary. "Once an urbanist, always an urbanist." |

## Content Boundaries

### What is generally shareable:
- General principles, frameworks, and mental models
- Industry trends and my perspective on them
- Questions I am wrestling with (without revealing specific answers or decisions)
- Lessons learned, abstracted from specific situations
- Responses to others' published work
- Historical examples from previous roles (with appropriate distance)
- Book/resource recommendations and commentary

### What is generally not shareable:
- Specific current projects or initiatives at my organization
- Vendor evaluations or procurement decisions in progress
- Internal organizational challenges or dynamics
- Anything that would require organizational approval to discuss publicly

### Handling ambiguity:
The boundary between shareable and not-shareable is a judgment call made post-by-post. When I am being deliberately vague due to confidentiality, I may signal this to Claude. Claude should not press for specifics when I indicate something is sensitive, and should help me find ways to discuss topics at an appropriate level of abstraction.

## Current Blog Themes & Recent Posts (Oct-Nov 2025)

### Primary Topics

**AI and Technology**: Recent posts reflect ongoing exploration of AI's practical applications in nonprofit contexts. Eddie views AI as a tool with specific strengths (well-defined tasks, content editing, code generation, document processing) but limitations (no critical thinking, struggles with ambiguous tasks). He advocates for a pragmatic "middle ground" approach rather than hype or doom. Recent posts include:

- "Meet Me in the AI Middle" (Nov 2025) - balanced perspective on AI in mission-driven nonprofits
- "AI Confidence Probabilities" (Jun 2025) - technical deep-dive on how AI confidence metrics work
- "Seriously Unserious: Bad AI In A Site" (Jul 2025) - learning project using local LLM inference

**Site/Meta Posts**: Documentation of website evolution and technical decisions:

- Recently migrated from WordPress to Jekyll static site generator
- Using Cloudflare Pages for deployment
- New features include search (via Lunr.js), responsive layout, nested navigation, image lightbox gallery
- "Vibe coding" with AI tools (GitHub Copilot) for rapid feature development
- Archiving old Phoenix-era posts with graceful redirects

**Nonprofit IT and Cybersecurity**: Practical IT leadership perspectives:

- Invoice fraud tactics and prevention
- QR code phishing attacks
- Security awareness topics
- CRM and document recognition automation projects

**Personal/Career Reflection**:

- Request for podcast guests (interested in nonprofit IT stories, 10-year anniversary of Downtown Phoenix Podcast)
- Career reflection and mission-driven work

### Writing Style Observations

- Clear, conversational tone that doesn't shy away from personality
- Technical posts are accessible to non-specialists
- Includes practical examples and real-world scenarios
- Frequently references own projects and hands-on experience
- Uses disclaimers about employer/client confidentiality
- Mix of "serious" technical posts and lighter/humorous content
- Proper attribution and credit given (alt text, photo credits, etc.)

## Inspirations

The new approach of this blog is inspired by the following people:

- **Scott Hanselman: [hanselman.com](https://www.hanselman.com/).** His approach to recurring blogging, especially as it relates to using blogs instead of emails or one-off communications, will inspire the ad-hoc nature of some content.
- **Tom MacWright: [macwright.com](https://www.macwright.com/).** I like his focus on technology and his integrated form of micro posts.
- **Simon Willison: [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/).** He has a lot of posts that are single-subject, short, and to the point.
