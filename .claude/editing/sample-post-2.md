In today's volatile landscape, resilience isn't just a buzzword: it's a survival skill. In this return of the *Friday Five*, here are strategies I've been implementing to stay adaptable and focused.

Before I begin, I want to mention something. The current political landscape in America is more than just background noise. It's something that's a genuine anxiety for all of us, as well as acutely impacting the lives and livelihoods of millions of our fellow citizens. The uncertainty of what our political leaders will do from one day to the next, whether it's cutting programs or eliminating jobs, can cause us to lose hope that tomorrow will be better. The economic pressures we're all facing, from rising costs of living that are exacerbated by stagnant wages, not to mention job layoffs and hiring market challenges, make it difficult to plan for the future. Some times, the mere act of day-to-day survival is planning ahead.

I've had genuine challenges whether to publish this piece, because it can certainly come across as severely disconnected from this current moment. In no way am I publishing this to discredit or dismiss the challenges that anyone is facing, and this post should not be read in that way. In moments like these, focusing on personal growth sure feels like a luxury. But it's precisely during times of profound uncertainty that our ability to adapt, connect, and remain constructively optimistic becomes our most powerful resource.

**1\. Strategic Prioritization**\
Delay non-critical investments and projects. Ask yourself: Is this essential for business operations or personal growth? Would an issue or outage caused by delaying a purchase or project be catastrophic? If not, consider putting it on hold. This doesn't mean inaction, but smart resource management while we all figure out what the new landscape will look like.

**2\. Elevate Soft Skills**\
In the world of information technology, we've ceded so much to technical prowess that we've forgotten the fundamental truth: we are in a service-oriented industry. When I was recruiting for new employees to join my IT team last year, I discovered that the most valuable candidates weren't those with the most impressive technical know-how or acumen, but those who demonstrated exceptional customer service and interpersonal skills. These are the team members who can translate complex technical concepts, listen empathetically, and collaborate across departments. As a service industry, we operate best when we transform technical challenges into meaningful solutions. In an increasingly automated world, our human capacity for communication and service is what truly sets us apart from mere machines.

**3\. Learn Skills outside of IT**\
Step outside your professional comfort zone. Explore skills beyond your primary domain. That hobby you have could be your next marketable talent. And the saying is true: it doesn’t feel like ‘work’ when it’s something you enjoy doing. In a world where competition for seemingly fewer and fewer job opportunities is the new normal, having diverse and niche skills will set you apart. Not to mention, hwve fun.

**4\. Rebuild Community Connections**\
We've become such an online culture that being with others in person is now seen as a revolutionary act. Seek out non-tech social clubs that challenge our digital isolation. \(There's a whole essay on this, but the work of Robert D. Putnam comes to mind.\) Whether it's a book club, a foodies group, or a gaming community, actively rebuild meaningful connections. These aren't just social outlets, they're platforms for personal growth and unexpected networking opportunities.

**5\. Maintain Constructive Optimism**\
In an era of constant uncertainty, it's easy to become cynical or disengaged. Resist the temptation to become bitter or jaded. This doesn't mean ignoring challenging realities. Channel your energy instead into meaningful action. Stay informed, but focus on what you can directly influence. Every small positive action, whether in your community, workplace, or personal development, is a step towards meaningful change.

Immediately following the President's address to Congress earlier this week, the Democratic response by Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan had something that we should all heed. We're told we have to care about all the things or that we have to care about the right things. But in reality, that's next to impossible. Instead, we should find one thing we're passionate about and engage on that.

> **Pick just one issue you’re passionate about — and engage.** And doom scrolling doesn’t count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can’t find one, start one.
