As then-President of the Board of the Midtown Neighborhood Association, I worked in conjunction with my counterparts at Downtown Voices Coalition and the Phoenix Downtown Neighborhood Alliance to present a mayoral debate on issues relevant to central-city Phoenix. Hosted at the Burton Barr Central Library in central Phoenix, KJZZ’s Christina Estes moderated and all four mayoral candidates were in attendance.
