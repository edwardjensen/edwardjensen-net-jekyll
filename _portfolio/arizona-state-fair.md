The follow-up book to _Phoenix’s Greater Encanto-Palmcroft Neighborhood_, author and neighborhood advocate G.G. George chronicled the history of the Arizona State Fair from its territorial days up to the present. I supported the project by managing image assets as well as providing original photography.
