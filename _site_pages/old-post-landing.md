If you've landed on this page expecting to see a specific post, you're here because that post has been retired. [You're welcome to read more](/archive), but in summary, when I migrated this blog to its current platform in early 2025, [I made the decision to retire posts](/posts/2025/2025-10/last-call-old-posts) that were no longer contemporary or relevant.

You're welcome to search for other posts using the [search function](/search) below, or browse the [current post index here](/writing). I have preserved a few retired posts as examples of my previous work, which you can see below the search box.

Thank you for your support and your understanding.
